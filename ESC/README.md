Exchange Security Collect
Script to collect Security information for Exchange OnPremises organization
This project was renamed the 09/11/2022 from ESI - Exchange Security Information to ESC - Exchange Security Collect


The goal of this document is to give an "How to" for :
- The collect
- The Excel file generation
- The explanation on how to analyze some security information collected by the script

**There will be no more update for the script.**
## Script Evolution
This script has been moved and updated to free Sentinel Solutions named :  **Microsoft Exchange Security for Exchange On-Premises** and **Microsoft Exchange Security for Exchange Online**

Beside the automatic collect, this solution provide workbooks that help automatically displayed configurations that can put your orgnization at risk.

Here the link for information around these solutions :
- [GitHub](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftExchangeSecurityGithub)
- [Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/help-protect-your-exchange-environment-with-microsoft-sentinel/ba-p/3872527)


## How to collect
To run the script :
- Unzip the script on the any drive in a folder name ESC
- Launch Exchange Management Shell in admin mode
- If the Exchange Management Tools are not installed, use the script ExchRemoteConnect.ps1 to start a remote PowerShell session to an Exchange server
- .\ExchRemoteConnect.ps1  -SRV SRVExchangeFQDN
- Run the script
- Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1
  - Parameters:
  - By default, no parameters are needed
  - Parameters:
    - Path : Path for the storage of the collected data 
      - If missing use the current folder \output
      - Specify \ at the end does not matter as the script will remove it
      - If - Path is not specify the script will create a folder Output in the ESC folder and store all the collected files in this folder
    - InputCSVPath: Path for the input config file
      - If missing, the script search the file in same directory than Script
    - DumpConfig
      - $False to not run tests that dump Exchange configuration settings
      - Default value : $true
    - QuickMode
      - $True to bypass all the tests that take time by connecting to servers
      - Can useful when it is needed to dump Exchane Configuration stored in AD and the Exchange server are not available (Ransomware attack for example)
      - Default value : $False
    - EDGE
      - $True if the script run on an EDGE server
      - Default value : $False
    - Example
      - .\Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1 - Path "C:\ESC\output"
      - .\Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1
      - .\Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1 - Path "C:\ESC\Output" -Inputcsvpath "C:\temp\temporaryCSVPath"
      - .\Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1 - Path "C:\ESC\output" -DumpConfig $False
      - .\Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1 - Path "C:\ESC\output" -QuickMode $true
      - .\Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.ps1 - Path "C:\ESC\output" -DumpConfig $False -QuickMode $true

    - For Help
      - .\ Get-ExchangeSecurityCollect.PS1 -?

## How to generate the Excel file
To generate the Excel file :
- If Excel is not install on the machine where the collect was done :
- Copy the folder ESC (source of the script and Output folder) on a secure machine where Excel is installed
- Launch PowerShell
- Launch the Cmllet New-ExchangeSecurityCollectReport.ps1 -path "path to the Output folder"
- Parameters:
    - -Path : Path for the storage of the collected data 
    - If missing use \output folder in the same directory as script
      - Specify \ at the end doesn't not matter as the script will remove it
    - DumpConfig
      - $False to not create Excel tab with Exchange configuration settings
      - Default value : $True
    - EDGE
      - $True if the script was run on an EDGE server
      - Default value : $False
-Example : 
    - .\New-ExchangeSecurityCollectReport.PS1
    - .\New-ExchangeSecurityCollectReport.PS1 -Path C:\ESC\Output
    - .\New-ExchangeSecurityCollectReport.PS1 -Path C:\ESC\Output -DumpConfig $False

## How to Analyse the Excel File

This script collects information regarding security configuration and overal Exchange configuration.
This section is focused on the security part. But remember that there is more than 70 tabs.
So this script can also be used to collect configuration information about your servers and organization's configueation.

For the Security part, for some tabs, a quick way to check the lastest modifications could be to check the WhenCreated and WhenChanged column when they are available.

- **MRA :**
    - Collect all the assignment between management roles, group and their scope
    - Focus on role with high privileges : 
    - Impersonation
    - Mailbox search
    - Mailbox Import Export
    - Mail Recipient : You should also pay attention to this role because it allows to give full access on every mailboxes
    - Ensure that scopes are used especially for Application Impersonation
    - If those roles need to be delegated, put a scope and monitor the group and the users with this delegation
    - You should also review the custom delegations in order to :
      - Check if they are still needed
      - If they are scoped
      - If they can be reduced in terms of privileges
      - If you need to know what the default delegations are, the cmdlet and parameters associated with each role… Check thhe  the file Dump_RBAC_2019CU12-Sept22.xls ( this is not the latest information, but it can help). This file contains the default RBAC configuration for a new Exchange 2019 CU 12 organization.
    - Delegating Management role assignments have been removed
- **MRCustom :**
    - Collect all the custom management roles with their scope
    - When custom roles are created this tab helps to check the parent role
- **MRCustomDetails :** 
    - Collect management roles' details
    - When custom roles are created this tab helps to check all the cmdlet and parameters that were kept in the role
- **MRScope :**
    - Collect custom management scopes
    - Focus on scope which too wide, ex :  include all mailbox for a domain…
- **AdminAuditLog :** 
    - Collect information about the configuration of AdminAudit log
    - Check if the default settings have been altered
    - Focus on :
      - AdminAuditLogEnabled : Should be True
      - AdminAuditLogCmdlets : should *
      - AdminAuditLogExcludedCmdlets : Should be empty
      - AdminAuditLogAgeLimit : should be at least 90 days
- **ReceiveConnector :**
    - Collect information on Receive Connector 
    - Focus on AuthMechanism with ExternalAuthoritative. This means that this Receive connectors I Open Relay
    - Focus on Anonymous Authentication
    - If Anonymous is checked, review the RemoteIPRanges
      - Should not include : 
        - ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255 
      - Subnet
    - Review the Tarpit

    - Collect information about Send Connector
    - Check TLS information
- **RemoteDomain :**
    - Collect all the Remote Domain and retrieve the value AutoForwardEnabled
    - Focus first on the DomainName * and check if the setting AutoForwardEnabled set to True. With this configuration any users can created Inbox rules to automatically forward any received messages to a mailbox outside of the organization
    - Review all the Remote Domain with  AutoForwardEnabled set to True
- **TransportRules :** 
    - Collect Transport Rule with one of these actions : BlindCopyTo, CopyTo, RedirectMessage
    - Review these Transport Rules and check if they are still accurate
    - Transport rules are used by attackers to automatically send message outside the organization
- **JournalRules:**
  - Collect Journal Rules
  - Review these Journal Rules
- **MbxDBJournaling :** 
    - Collect the property JournalRecipient for all databases
    - Review the databases that have a JournalRecipient set

    - Collect ReceiveAs permissions on the database object
    - This permission set Full Access mailboxes for the user accounts on all mailboxes in the target database
- **MailboxDatabaseSendAs :** 
    - Collect SendAs permissions on the database object
    - This permissions allow the user to have the permissions Send-As on all mailboxes in the target database
- **PartConfPerm**
    - This tab shows the permssions on containers and servers object in the configuration partition where Exchange information are stored
    - The help with the analysis, and display non standard permissions
    - Add the following Filter :
      - isInherited :  False

    - Remember that Pop should be disabled on all mailboxes except those which really need it. When a mailbox is created POP is enabled by default
- **IMAP :**
    - Collect IMAP
    - Focus on LogonType : Plaintext Authentication
